1)	HoverCraft:
	
		input type: what input should the script use? :
			-axes - use axes;
			-other - asighn input from other script by function "parseInput" ;
				center: center of the veicle;
		liftTypeSpace: lift forces add space:
			-world - Vector3.up;
			-local - transform.up;
		
		forwardVector: forward of the vehicle;
		forwardSpeed: speed of vehicle that is applyied forward when going forward;
		backwardsSpeed: speed of vehicle that is applyied backwards when going backwards; 
		maxSpeed: the maxinum velocity.magditud for the hoovercraft to apply forces forward/backwards;
		forwardForceMode: forceMode of forces forward/backwards;
		
		angularSpeed: torque applyied to rotate the veicle;
		maxAngularSpeed: the maxinum angularVelocity.magditud for the hoovercraft to apply Torque left/right;
		angularForceMode: forceMode of Torques left/right;
		
		groundDetectionDistance: distance that the vehicle will detect the ground from groundDetector;
		groundDetector: a point from which the ground will be detected;
		groundLayer: the layer that the ground  is on;
		hooverHeight: desired height for the hoovercraft to be on (will be a little lover);

		maxNormalAngle: the maximum normal diffrence accepable to float with out moving sideways;
        normalFixForce: force used to push veicle of hill with slope over maxNormal angle;
		normalFixForceMode: ForceMode used for normalFixForce;

		additionalGroundedForceUp: the force that is applyied for the vehicle when it is grounded up;
		additionalUnGroundedForceUp: the force that is applyied for the vehicle when it is not grounded up;
		
		jumpForce: the force of jump;
		jumpForceMode: forceMode of the jump;
		
		HoverPoints:
			-point: position of the hoverpoint;
			-liftFoce: force used to lift the vehicle on this point;
			-liftForceMode: the forceMode of force used to lift the vehicle;
			-whenToLevel: the conditions for the vehicle to start leveling (proces of making v3 up to vehicle up);
			-levelingForce: the force of leveling;
			-upLevelingOffset: the ofset from the "point" up, for better leveling;
			-LevelingHeightDiffrenceTolerance: the tolerance of diffrent height when leveling;
			-levelingForceMode: forceMode used for leveling;

2) camera:
	target: the target of the camera;
	Speed: the speed that the camera will follow the camPos with;
	cam: camera transform;
	camPos: desired position of the camera;

3) hoverCraftEditor:
	this script is just a custom editor, to make the creation of hovercrafts easier.
